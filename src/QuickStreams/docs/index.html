	<h1>Preface</h1>
	<div class="section preface" style="text-align:center;">
		<p><b>QuickStreams</b> is an asynchronous programming library,
		inspired by <a href="http://reactivex.io/">Reactive Extensions</a>,
		implementing the <a href="https://goo.gl/adn5qW">
		Reactive Programming Paradigm</a>. It provides a
		consistent communication protocol for various application components and
		allows describing complex asynchronous behavior in a more efficient way
		reducing code complexity and enhancing stability.</p>
	</div>

	<minimizable><div slot="content">
		<p><a href="https://goo.gl/L65lLK">Signals & Slots</a> are an integral
		part of the <a href="https://goo.gl/53uH3A">Qt Quick</a> architecture
		providing a powerful low level mechanism for responsive
		<a href="https://goo.gl/fLnigX">asynchronous programming</a>.
		Despite the fact that Signals & Slots are a very flexible instrument
		they're not very well suited for the declarative description of rather
		complex asynchronous operations and
		<a href="https://goo.gl/DVKEWR">transactions</a>.</p>

		<p>To increase readability and maintainability of asynchronous code
		higher level abstraction concepts like
		<a href="https://goo.gl/KC5odw">Callbacks</a> and more sophisticated
		concepts like <a href="https://goo.gl/gxb84g">Promises and Futures</a>
		are used, however, those are simple, primitive concepts,
		providing only a very limited set of features to solve only the basic
		problems of declarative, asynchronous control flow and event handling.
		</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://reactivex.io/">Reactive Extensions</a> approach
		provides a great concept for asynchronous
		<a href="https://goo.gl/XV2uU7">event handling and processing</a>
		introducing the
		<a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">
		Obervable</a> primitive but lacks features for the declaration of
		custom data stream representing rather complex (nested, abortable,
		pausable, resumable) <a href="https://goo.gl/DVKEWR">transactions</a>.
		</p>

		<p><b>QuickStreams</b> is built on top of Qt Quick's Signals & Slots
		mechanism and provides two programming primitives covering both,
		asynchronous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">
		control flow</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/XV2uU7">event handling</a>:
		</p>

		<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Streams</b> - Streams declaratively describe asynchronous
			control flow. They can be chained into
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Sequence">
			sequences</a> and also abstract sequences representing them
			as one higher stream.
		</li>
		<li><b>Observers</b> - Observers process events emitted by streams.
		Multiple observers can be chained into
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)">
		event processing pipelines</a> and initiate new stream sequences.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A stream can be in either of the following states: <b>Dead</b>,
		<b>Active</b> or <b>Aborted</b>.
		Once created, it's initially dead (yet not born)
		and queued to be awoken and executed on the next possible event loop
		cycle. If another stream takes it's ownership before it's awoken - the
		execution is deferred until the point the owner stream is closed. This
		way streams can form asynchronous sequences to be executed serially.</p>

		<p>During it's life time a stream emits events, though some of them
		are lethal. If a stream emits the <b>closure</b>, <b>abortion</b> or
		<b>failure</b> events
		- it dies, but in certain circumstances streams can be resurrected and
		executed again.</p>

		<ul class="context-list">
			<li><b>• Closure</b> - The closure event is emitted when a stream
			finally dies of its own, natural death. It optionally carries an
			arbitrary set of data to be picked up by the next stream in the
			sequence, that is to be awoken.</li>

			<li><b>• Failure</b> - The failure event is emitted when a stream
			perishes due to an internal failure. It optionally carries an
			arbitrary set of data to be picked up
			by the failure recovery stream, that is to be awoken.</li>

			<li><b>• Abortion</b> - The abortion event is emitted when a stream
			is killed due to abortion requested from the outside. It awakes
			the abortion recovery stream if there is one.</li>

			<li><b>• Custom</b> - A custom event is identified by a name,
			optionally carrying an arbitrary set of data. Streams
			can be assigned to be awoken on the events of other streams.</li>

	<img src="img/sequence.svg">

	<minimizable><div slot="content">
		<p>One of the fundamentals of asynchronous programming is the
		declarative creation of asynchronous operation sequences.
		Streams can form sequences using the <b>attach</b> operator.
		When a stream is being closed it awakes the next attached stream
		if there is one, passing the asynchronous result to it,
		before finally dying.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Using the <b>.attach</b> operator</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">asyncFunction()
.attach(function(stream, asyncResult) {
	console.log('result:', asyncResult)
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>In the example above <b>asyncFunction</b> returns a stream.
		Right after the function call the returned stream gets a new stream
		attached.
		The second stream is created by the <b>attach</b> operator out of
		the given function, it will receive the asynchronous result as
		<i>asyncResult</i> when the returned stream is closed and thus
		the second is awoken.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Declaring a sequence of 4 streams</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">http.post('http://server.org/oranges')
.attach(http.post('http://server.org/apples'))
.attach(http.post('http://server.org/bananas'))
.attach(function(stream) {
	console.log('all 3 were posted sequentially')
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>When the <b>attach</b> operator receives a stream target
		it will acquire its ownership preventing it from executing freely,
		thus forcing it to execute sequentially.</p>
		
		<p>The stream returned by the first <b>http.post</b> is not acquired
		by any other stream thus considered a <i>free stream</i>, meaning it'll
		awake and execute in the next event loop cycle.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Wrapping one stream into another</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">http.get('http://server.org/assets')
.attach(function(stream, assets) {
	return http.post('http://server.org/form', assets)
})
.attach(function(stream) {
	console.log('successfully posted')
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>It's often necessary to pass the results of one asynchronous
		operation to the next that's attached to it.
		This cannot be done at the time of the sequence declaration as the
		results are yet unknown. For this case a stream can be created during
		the execution of another stream and returned to it
		as in the example above.</p>

	<h2>Failure Recovery</h2>

	<minimizable><div slot="content">
		<p>A failure recovery mechanism is an important part of the
		asynchronous control flow. To prevent undefined behavior and
		malfunctions caused by unexpectedly failed streams
		QuickStreams provides the <b>failure</b> sequence operator.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Recovering from unexpected failure</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">http.get('http://server.org/assets')

.attach(function(stream, postResult) {
	console.log('successfully posted:', postResult)
})
.failure(function(stream, error) {
	console.log('failure:', error)
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>The <b>failure</b> operator acts upon the entire sequence, it
		defines the stream that is awoken if anywhere in the sequence
		an unexpected error is thrown.</p>

		<p>If in the example above any of the streams fail
		(network might be unreachable) the sequence is broken and the stream
		created by the <b>failure</b> operator awoken instead.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Recovering from failure in 2 consecutive sequences</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">http.get('http://server.org/assets')
.attach(function(stream, assets) {
	console.log('retrieved assets:', assets)
})
.failure(http.delete('http://server.org/options'))
.attach(function(stream) {
	console.log('failed, but managed to clean up')
})
.failure(function(stream, error) {
	console.log('even cleanup failed:', error)
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>The <b>failure</b> operator starts a new sequence which could also
		fail and recover as in the example above.</p>
	</div></minimizable>


	<h2>Retrial</h2>

	<minimizable><div slot="content">
		<p>There are situations when certain failures are expected
		but shouldn't necessarily break the sequence. QuickStreams offers
		the <b>retry</b> stream operator for such cases.</p>

		<p>The <b>retry</b> operator takes an array of error samples and an
		optional number of times to retry. If a stream with the <b>retry</b>
		operator applied - fails and the thrown error matches one of the given
		samples, then the sequence doesn't break, instead the stream is
		resurrected and executed again.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">

.attach(function(stream, assets) {
	console.log('retrieved assets:', assets)
})
.failure(function(stream, error) {
	console.log('failed retrieving assets:', error)
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>A good use case example is a network request.
		Networks tend to be temporarily unreachable from time to time
		and requests to it might sometimes fail (timeout). Though most of the
		time the request should be retried for a couple of times before finally
		giving up.</p>

		<p>The above example demonstrates a similar situations, where the
		network request is retried for 3 times on timeouts before breaking
		the sequence and redirecting control flow to the stream provided by the
		<b>failure</b> operator. But if the request failed nevertheless but due
		to another error (like a 500 - Internal Server Error) the sequence will
		break.</p>

		<p>Asynchronous loops are harder to describe than regular
		synchronous ones. To avoid unreadable, pseudo-recursive, asynchronous
		constructs QuickStreams offers the <b>repeat</b> stream operator.</p>

		<p>The <b>repeat</b> operator takes a condition (a function returning
		a boolean) and resurrects the stream it was applied on until the
		condition returns false.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">

	return false
})
.attach(function(stream) {
	console.log('repeated http.get 10 times')
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>In the example above the <b>repeat</b> operator is applied on the
		stream returned by the asynchronous http.get method. It uses the
		context variable <i>counter</i> to keep track of the passed steps and
		decides on each iteration whether to repeat (resurrect and execute)

	})
	.repeat()
})
}</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>In the example above <b>spawnCounter</b> creates a continuous stream

		carrying the number of the current iteration.</p>

	<p class="subtitle non-desktop">Streams and sequences can be recursively

	<minimizable><div slot="content">
		<p>One of the hardest asynchronous problems to deal with is abortion.
		It's relatively hard to describe a sequence of transactions that might
		be asked to abort at any time. Additionally there could be an
		obligatory asynchronous clean up sequence involved making the code
		even more complicated, hard to read and maintain.</p>

		QuickStreams makes describing complex, abortable, asynchronous
		operations easier by providing a way of building higher level
		abstractions using the <b>Streams Paradigm</b> turning complex
		stream sequences into abstract, higher level streams
		using the <b>stream hierarchies</b> approach.</p>

		<p>QuickStreams provides 2 types of streams: <b>Atomic Streams</b> and
		<b>Abortable Streams</b>.</p>

		</p><b>Atomic Streams</b> are indivisible and cannot be aborted,
		whereas <b>Abortable Streams</b> are abortable during their life time.
		Stream sequences can be thought of as abortable streams and can in
		fact be wrapped into one.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Defining an asynchronous, abortable transaction</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">function moveDocuments(fromUri, toUri) {
	// create and return an abortable stream
	// representing the document movement transaction
	return QuickStreams.create(function(mainStream) {
		var documents = []
		var current = -1

		var sequence = mainStream.adopt(http.get(fromUri))
		.attach(function(stream, docs) {
			// bring the results to the main streams context
			documents = docs
		})
		.attach(function(stream, docs) {
			return http.post(toUri, documents[current])
		})
		.repeat(function(isSequenceAborted) {
			current++

			// stop repeating the atomic http.post stream
			// if the sequence (moveDocuments) was aborted
			if(isSequenceAborted) return false

			if(current < documents.length) return true
			return false
		})
		
		// execute this async clean up sequence
		// after an execution failure or an abortion
		// before letting the moveDocuments stream die
		function cleanup(error) {
			http.delete(toUri)
			.attach(function(stream) {
				if(error) {
					// moveDocuments failed during execution time
					mainStream.fail({
						execution: error,
						cleanup: null
					})
				} else {
					// moveDocuments was aborted
					// but managed to clean up successfully
					mainStream.close()
				}
			})
			.failure(function(cleanupError) {
				// moveDocuments unexpectedly failed
				// during the cleanup procedure
				mainStream.fail({
					execution: error,
					cleanup: cleanupError
				})
			})
		}

		// clean up, if moveDocuments unexpectedly failed
		// before letting the moveDocuments stream die
		sequence.failure(function(stream, error) {
			cleanup(error)
		})

		// clean up, if moveDocuments was aborted
		// before letting the moveDocuments stream die
		sequence.abortion(function(stream) {
			cleanup(error)
		})
	}, QuickStreams.Abortable)
}</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>In the above example <b>moveDocuments</b> represents an abortable,
		asynchronous transaction, moving documents from one host onto another.
		It must clean up unfinished work in case of an
		unexpected failure during its execution as well as in case of
		an abortion.</p>

		<p><b>moveDocuments</b> creates and returns an <b>Abortable Stream</b>
		effectively representing an easy to use abstraction over the entire
		process. The main stream acquires parentship over the underlying
		sequence using the <b>adopt</b> stream method making the sequence
		subordinate.</p>

		<div class="code">
		<div class="code-header">
			<span class="lang">JavaScript</span>
			<p>Using the asynchronous <b>moveDocuments</b> function</p>
		</div>
		<pre><code class="javascript">var movDocStream = moveDocuments(
'http://one.org/documents',
'http://another.org/documents'
)

var sequence = movDocStream.attach(function(stream) {
console.log('moveDocuments successfully completed')
})

sequence.failure(function(stream, error) {
console.log('moveDocuments failed:', error)	
})

sequence.abortion(function(stream) {
console.log('moveDocuments successfully aborted')	
})

// If moveDocuments didn't complete after 50 milliseconds - abort it!
// The abort won't do anything if the stream's already dead
QuickStreams.timeout(50, function(stream) {
movDocStream.abort()
})</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>Using <b>moveDocuments</b> is quite simple as it's just a regular,
		abortable stream. When the stream returned by <b>moveDocuments</b>
		closes - the documents are successfully moved. If it's aborted or
		fails during its execution it'll properly clean up before moving
		control flow to one of the given streams in the above usage example.
		</p>

		<i>movDocStream</i> abstracts away the implementation providing a
		consistent stream interface. All interaction with this stream will
		reflect onto the underlying, subordinate sequence.</p>

		<p>Even if, in the above example, the <i>sequence</i> is aborted
		during the execution of the atomic <b>http.get</b> stream - the bound
		stream performing the logger entry will still be awoken and executed.
		The control flow will be redirected to the abortion stream only when
		the bound stream is closed.</p>

})
// the resource deletion is obligatory as well!
.bind(http.delete('http://server.org/assets'))
.attach(/* ... */)</code></pre>
		</div>

		<p>Streams can be bound to other bound streams as well forming a chain
		of obligatory operations. In the example above both, the logger entry
		and the delete will execute sequentially even if the <i>sequence</i>
		was aborted during the execution of the atomic <b>http.get</b> stream.
